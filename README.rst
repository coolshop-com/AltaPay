Running the Tests
+++++++++++++++++
First of all, have `tox <http://tox.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ installed on your system. System-wide is probably the better choice. Once you have tox installed, simply run:

.. code:: python

    tox

This will run all tests, against all supported Python versions.
